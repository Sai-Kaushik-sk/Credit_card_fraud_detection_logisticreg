# Introduction:

Developed a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud. Model detects if a transaction made is a fraudulent transaction or a legit transaction, this was done using the logistic regression machine learning model. This is a Classification type model which tell us the probability of a variable. he model was implemented in Python using VS Code as the IDE, leveraging libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, and scikit-learn for building and evaluating the model.

## At a Glance:

Objective: Build a model to detect credit card fraud.

Tools to build the model: Built in python using libraries like Numpy, Pandas and Scikit learn.

Data: Has been collected from Kaggle

## Tasks:
1) Imported the dependencies
2) Collection and analysis of data 
3) Using the under-sampling technique
4) Concatenated the 2 sample data sets
5) Splitting the data set into dependent and independent variables
6) Trained the model
7) Evaluate the model using accuracy score
